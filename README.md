# OOP Exercises
This repository contains the code solutions from the OOP exercises from HSLU spring-semester 2020.

## Startup

All solutions are written with NetBeans in Java 11 (except Wiki).

## Folder structure

OriginalSolutions   --> Contains nearly all exercises.
AdditionalTraining  --> Contains rewritten/refactored exercises as a training for the MEP.
GuiExamples         --> Contains different examples from multiple GUI technologies.
