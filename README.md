# OOP Exercises
This repository contains the code solutions from the OOP exercises from HSLU spring-semester 2020.

## Startup

All solutions are written with NetBeans in Java 11 (except Wiki).

## Folder structure

OriginalSolutions   --> Contains nearly all exercises.<br/>
AdditionalTraining  --> Contains rewritten/refactored exercises as a training for the MEP.<br/>
GuiExamples         --> Contains different examples from multiple GUI technologies from Java.<br/>
MEP                 --> Contains the exercises from the MEP. It's sadly not allowed to publish the exercise paper itself.<br/>
Wiki                --> Contains a wiki in HTML/JS/CSS with search function.<br/>
